        <h1>About the Indian Constitution</h1>
    </header>

    <!-- 3D Styled Info Box -->
    <div class="info-box">
        <p>The <strong>Constitution of India</strong> is the supreme law and foundation of the country’s governance, adopted on November 26, 1949, and enforced on January 26, 1950. It is the longest written constitution in the world, originally consisting of 395 articles, 22 parts, and 8 schedules, which have expanded over time. The Preamble declares India to be a <strong>Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, and Democratic Republic</strong>, ensuring justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for all citizens.</p>
        <p><strong>Fundamental Rights</strong> (Articles 12-35) guarantee basic freedoms, while Directive Principles of State Policy (Articles 36-51) provide guidelines for socio-economic development. Fundamental Duties, added in 1976, outline the moral responsibilities of citizens. The Constitution establishes a parliamentary system with a division of powers between the Union and States, emphasizing federalism with a unitary bias during emergencies.</p>
        <p>Its independent judiciary upholds constitutional supremacy and safeguards citizens' rights. Emergency provisions (Articles 352, 356, and 360) enable the government to manage crises. The Constitution is amendable through <strong>Article 368</strong>, balancing flexibility and rigidity to adapt to changing needs. It remains a living document, fostering unity in diversity and guiding India's democratic journey.</p>

        <p>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, known as <strong>Baba Saheb Ambedkar</strong>, was a social reformer, jurist, and the principal architect of the Indian Constitution. Born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, he rose from an oppressed background to become one of India's most influential leaders.</p>
        <p>A highly educated scholar, he earned degrees from Columbia University, the London School of Economics, and Gray’s Inn, specializing in law, economics, and political science.</p>
        <p>As Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, Ambedkar played a pivotal role in shaping India’s democratic framework. He advocated for fundamental rights that ensured equality, liberty, and justice for all citizens, emphasizing the abolition of untouchability (Article 17).</p>
        <p>A champion for Dalit rights, Ambedkar worked tirelessly to eradicate caste-based discrimination. Honored with the <strong>Bharat Ratna</strong> in 1990, Ambedkar’s legacy continues to guide India as a beacon of social equality and justice.</p>
